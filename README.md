# Mask_RCNN
Instance Segmentation - First steps in machine vision
This is my first project in machine vision. I've meticulously followed the article from Pulkit Sharma on AnalyticsVidhya (Link: https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2019/07/computer-vision-implementing-mask-r-cnn-image-segmentation/) for this task. Here I've used the matterport implementation of the Mask_RCNN model, pretrained on the COCO dataset.
